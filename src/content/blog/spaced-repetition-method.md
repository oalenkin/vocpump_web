# How Spaced Repetition Works and Why It's the Most Effective Learning Method

Spaced repetition isn't just a trendy term in the language learning world. It's a scientifically proven method that helps you retain information long-term with minimal effort.

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is a learning technique where material is reviewed at increasing intervals. Instead of reviewing a word 10 times in a row today, you review it:

- Today
- In 1 day
- In 3 days
- In 1 week
- In 2 weeks
- And so on

## The Science Behind It

Research shows that our brain retains information better when we review it just as we're about to forget it. This phenomenon is known as the "Forgetting Curve" discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Time Efficient** - you only spend time on what truly needs review
2. **Long-term Memory** - information moves to long-term memory instead of being forgotten
3. **Less Effort** - no need to cram for hours

## How It Works in Our Bot

Our Telegram bot automatically determines the optimal time to review each word. You simply:

1. Add words to your deck
2. Study when the bot reminds you
3. Rate how well you remember

The algorithm adapts to you, showing difficult words more frequently and easy ones less often.
