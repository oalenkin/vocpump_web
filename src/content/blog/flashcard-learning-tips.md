# 5 Tips for Language Learning with Flashcards

Flashcards are one of the most popular language learning methods. But not everyone uses them correctly. Here are 5 tips to help you learn faster and more effectively.

## 1. Add Context

**Bad:**
```
cat - a small furry animal
```

**Good:**
```
The cat is sleeping on the sofa
```

By learning words in context, you learn how to use them correctly, not just their translation.

## 2. Don't Make Decks Too Large

The ideal deck size for learning is 20-30 new words. Adding 100 words at once makes it hard to remember everything.

**Tip:** Create themed decks

- "At the Cafe" deck
- "At Work" deck
- "Travel" deck

## 3. Study Regularly, But in Small Doses

Better to study 10 minutes daily than one hour once a week.

**Why?**

- The brain needs time to consolidate memory
- Regularity creates a habit
- Short sessions don't cause fatigue

## 4. Use Both Directions

Don't only study "English → Your Language". Practice the reverse too: "Your Language → English".

This helps:

- Activate your active vocabulary
- Learn to recall words quickly when speaking
- Remember words more deeply

## 5. Only Add Words You Need

Don't try to learn the entire dictionary. Add words that:

- You encounter frequently
- Are needed for your goals
- Interest you personally

**Example:** If you're a programmer, you need technical terms. If you're a traveler - tourist vocabulary.

## Bonus: Use Spaced Repetition

Don't review all cards every day. Let the algorithm decide when to show each card.

Our Telegram bot automatically uses spaced repetition. Just study when it reminds you!
